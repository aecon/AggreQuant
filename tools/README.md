# Tools for image processing


## Copy and Rename files

**Note**:
* This tool assumes that your tif files contain the identifiers "Blue", "Green", and "FarRed".

Open the terminal inside this folder (Right click -> Open in terminal).

Then, in the terminal type:
```
./run_copy_rename.sh  <PATH>
```
where `<PATH>` is the full path to the plate directory, which contains the tiff images.
Hit Enter.
