"""
1. Create Image Segmentation Modules/Classes:
- Implement separate modules/classes for image segmentation of cells, nuclei, and aggregates.
- Each module/class should contain different algorithms for segmentation within its respective category.
- Ensure that the modules/classes have a consistent interface for segmenting images and return the segmented images as output.

2. Implement Comparison Functions:
- Develop functions that compare the results of different algorithms within each segmentation category.
- These functions should take the segmented images from different algorithms as input and provide a comparison metric or evaluation.
- You can use established evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or custom metrics specific to your segmentation task.

3. Parallelize the Processing:
- Utilize both the GPU and CPUs for parallel processing to minimize the overall processing time.
- Assign different tasks to different processing units to maximize efficiency.

4. Divide and Parallelize the Tasks:
- Split the 10,000 images of each category (cells, nuclei, aggregates) into smaller batches to distribute the workload evenly across the available processing units.
- Assign a batch of images to each CPU core for parallel processing.
- Utilize the GPU for nuclei segmentation, as it tends to benefit significantly from GPU acceleration.

5. Perform Parallel Processing:
- Use multiprocessing techniques to parallelize the image segmentation and comparison tasks.
- Create a pool of worker processes for CPU parallelization, where each worker process handles a batch of images.
- Assign each worker process the task of segmenting images using different algorithms within a specific category (cells, nuclei, aggregates).
- Run the segmentation algorithms for nuclei and cells on the GPU within each worker process.
- Compare the results of different algorithms within each category using the comparison functions.

6. Collect and Analyze Results:
- Collect the segmented images and comparison results from the worker processes.
- Analyze the results to identify the best-performing algorithms within each category based on the comparison metrics.
- Generate any additional statistics or metrics you require.
